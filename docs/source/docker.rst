******************
Why Docker? üê≥
******************

- **Consistency:** Docker ensures that the software runs the same way, regardless of where it‚Äôs deployed.
- **Isolation:** Each Docker container is isolated, preventing conflicts between different software environments.
- **Portability:** Docker containers can be easily shared and run on any system with Docker installed, making it ideal for collaboration and deployment.

******************
Installing Docker
******************

.. important::
   Ensure that Virtualization is enabled in BIOS for your system.

Windows
=======

.. important::
   Ensure that WSL is enabled in your Windows.

1. **Download Docker Desktop:** Go to the `Docker Desktop for Windows <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/>`_ download page.
2. **Install Docker Desktop:** Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. **Start Docker Desktop:** After installation, Docker will start automatically. You can access it from the Start menu.
4. **Verify Installation:** Open PowerShell and run the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker run hello-world

Linux
======

1. **Update Your System:** Open your terminal and run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt update
      sudo apt upgrade

2. **Install Docker:** Go to the `Docker Desktop for Linux <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/>`_ and follow the instructions.

3. **Verify Installation:** Open your terminal and run the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker run hello-world

MacOS
=======

1. **Download Docker Desktop:** Visit the `Docker Desktop for Mac <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/>`_ download page.
2. **Install Docker Desktop:** Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag the Docker icon to your Applications folder.
3. **Start Docker:** Launch Docker from your Applications folder. Docker will start running in the background.
4. **Verify Installation:** Open your terminal and run the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker run hello-world

**********************
Cloning the Repository
**********************

Clone the repository on your local machine using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Robotics-Society-PEC/Getting-Started-With-Robotics.git

*************************
Building the Docker Image
*************************

.. important::
   Ensure that you run this command from within the repository.

This repo provides a Docker image with Ubuntu installed. To build the image, run the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker build -t <name_of_image> .

After the image is done building, you can enter the Linux environment using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -it <name_of_image>

***************************************************
Linking Local Volume to Docker using Docker Compose
***************************************************

Why Do We Need to Link Volumes?
===============================

When working inside a Docker container, you might create or modify files within the container's filesystem. However, these changes are isolated from your local machine, which means:

- **Files created or modified inside the container** will not automatically appear in your local filesystem.
- **Git won't be able to track changes** made inside the container since they aren't visible in your local directory.

To solve this, we can link a directory inside the Docker container to a directory on your local machine. This way, any changes made in the container will be reflected on your local machine, and vice versa.

What is Docker Compose? üê≥
==========================

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define all your services, networks, and volumes in a single ``YAML`` file. This simplifies the process of managing complex applications by allowing you to spin up an entire environment with a single command.

Setting Up Docker Compose
=========================

1. Create a ``docker-compose.yml`` File
-------------------------------------

Create a new file named ``docker-compose.yml`` in your project directory. This file will define the Docker services and link the volumes.

.. code-block:: yaml

   services:
     robotics-env:
       build: .
       volumes:
         - ./workspace:/home/myuser/workspace
       stdin_open: true # Equivalent to `-i` in `docker run`
       tty: true # Equivalent to `-t` in `docker run`
       command: /bin/bash

Explanation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``stdin_open: true``: This is equivalent to using the ``-i`` flag with ``docker run``. It keeps the standard input (stdin) open even if not attached.
- ``tty: true``: This is equivalent to using the ``-t`` flag with ``docker run``. It allocates a pseudo-TTY, which makes the terminal session interactive.
- ``command: /bin/bash``: Ensures that when the container starts, it opens a bash shell, allowing you to interact with the container.

2. Run Docker Compose
---------------------

To start the container in interactive mode, simply use:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose up

This command will start your container as specified in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file, attaching the terminal to it, so you can interact with the shell inside the container.

3. Accessing the Container
--------------------------

Once the container is running, you should automatically be placed inside the container's bash shell, where you can run commands interactively.

Running in Detached Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you later want to run the container in detached mode (not interactively), you can add the ``-d`` flag to the ``docker-compose up`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose up -d

This runs the container in the background, freeing up your terminal for other tasks.

4. Creating a File inside the Container
---------------------------------------

Let's test this by creating a file inside the container and ensuring it's visible on your local machine.

1. **Inside the Docker Container:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      touch /home/myuser/workspace/newfile.txt

2. **On your local machine:** Check your ``./workspace`` directory, and you should see ```newfile.txt``` there.

This synchronization ensures that all your work inside the Docker environment is consistent with your local development setup, making it easier to manage code and collaborate.
