Documentation
#############

An important aspect of building robotic systems is the documentation, because of the large amount of components involved one tends to forget their configuration and functionalities. Proper documentation is required for
easier debugging, maintenance, and scalability of the system. You should write documentation for yourself, if not for others to read, like I have made this documentation for myself and in the process it helps others to
contribute to your project.
